Version 1.32 dev
-removed missing dependency

Version 1.31
-import issue
-refactoring of package layout
-small fixes
ISSUE: missing dependency

version 1.3
-added irisr dataset
-made pca_test.py aware of iris dataset and interfaced it
-removed pca_test.py -> pca class interfacing data parser
-commenting data with # enabled
-enabled datasets with properties == 0
-header decides now how much parameter are parsed. throws error only if there are less entries in the data segment than specified by the header

version 1.24
-removed output when marking cells. the marked cells are soley visible in the matrixdata output

version 1.23
-fixed bug with wrong value in matrixdata
-dumps a file with the sorting steps
-added filename and version to dumpnames
-added licence and copyright informations
-fixed the sorted by file output
ISSUES:
-value zero isn't handle correctly (outside of legend)
-sorting might be somewhat impaired
-values in matrixdata are only somwhat near the raw data, due to information lost when applying ceil. however, just sortign w/o any normalization will yield the correct order of values as the labesl in the matrix indicate
-normalized and raw data yield different results when sorted

version 1.22
-bug with extrem values fixed/found source (func sort_reduction only tested for single parameter)
ISSUES:
-matrix data shows correct placement of labels, and correct marking, but wrong values are fetched for the _matrixdata
-sorted by file doesn't work

version 1.21
-some cleanup in the codebase (removed antigen car related variable names)
-added testdata
-cleaned up evaluate function
-bugfixing debug mode
-matrix now does exatly what is said, concerning weigts and refs. evaluate function is tailored concordingly
ISSUES:
extrem values (every value of a parameter is equal, is zero, is one) seems to breake default sorting function

version 1.2
-clicking on the legend now markes all the samples in the legend tile clicked
-clicking again unmarks all samples
-the marked status is shown by a magenta, dotted line in the legend
-the marked samples will be written into the matrix data output inclusive where to find the marked samples in the legend

version 1.1
-parser expects now a header of the form

parameter;n
properties;m
